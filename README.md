# tic-tac-toe
Commit on July 26 of working game.
Still need to figure out how to determine winner by looping through a red array or a blue array and comparing that to the
winningCombos array that contains all the arrays of winning combinations.

Need to change message for a win or a draw so that they appear on the page and not as an alert.

Need to change play again function so that it resets the board instead of just refreshing the page. This will be even more
important if player names are added and their score is being kept. Page refresh will lose that.
